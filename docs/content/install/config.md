# Configuration

The `lora-app-server` binary has the following command-line flags:

{{<highlight text>}}
LoRa App Server is an open-source application-server, part of the LoRa Server project
	> documentation & support: https://www.loraserver.io/lora-app-server
	> source & copyright information: https://github.com/brocaar/lora-app-server

Usage:
  lora-app-server [flags]
  lora-app-server [command]

Available Commands:
  configfile  Print the LoRa Application Server configuration file
  help        Help about any command
  version     Print the LoRa App Server version

Flags:
  -c, --config string   path to configuration file (optional)
  -h, --help            help for lora-app-server
      --log-level int   debug=5, info=4, error=2, fatal=1, panic=0 (default 4)

Use "lora-app-server [command] --help" for more information about a command.

## Configuration file

By default `lora-app-server` will look in the following order for a
configuration file at the following paths when `--config` is not set:

* `lora-app-server.toml` (current working directory)
* `$HOME/.config/lora-app-server/lora-app-server.toml`
* `/etc/lora-app-server/lora-app-server.toml`

To load configuration from a different location, use the `--config` flag.

To generate a new configuration file `lora-app-server.toml`, execute the following command:

{{<highlight bash>}}
lora-app-server configfile > lora-app-server.toml
{{< /highlight >}}

Note that this configuration file will be pre-filled with the current configuration
(either loaded from the paths mentioned above, or by using the `--config` flag).
This makes it possible when new fields get added to upgrade your configuration file
while preserving your old configuration. Example:

{{<highlight bash>}}
lora-app-server configfile --config lora-app-server-old.toml > lora-app-server-new.toml
{{< /highlight >}}

Example configuration file:

{{<highlight toml>}}
[general]
# Log level
#
# debug=5, info=4, warning=3, error=2, fatal=1, panic=0
log_level=4

# The number of times passwords must be hashed. A higher number is safer as
# an attack takes more time to perform.

# PostgreSQL settings.
#
# Please note that PostgreSQL 9.5+ is required.
[postgresql]
# PostgreSQL dsn (e.g.: postgres://user:password@hostname/database?sslmode=disable).
#
# Besides using an URL (e.g. 'postgres://user:password@hostname/database?sslmode=disable')
# it is also possible to use the following format:
# 'user=loraserver dbname=loraserver sslmode=disable'.
#
# The following connection parameters are supported:
#
# * dbname - The name of the database to connect to
# * user - The user to sign in as
# * password - The user's password
# * host - The host to connect to. Values that start with / are for unix domain sockets. (default is localhost)
# * port - The port to bind to. (default is 5432)
# * sslmode - Whether or not to use SSL (default is require, this is not the default for libpq)
# * fallback_application_name - An application_name to fall back to if one isn't provided.
# * connect_timeout - Maximum wait for connection, in seconds. Zero or not specified means wait indefinitely.
# * sslcert - Cert file location. The file must contain PEM encoded data.
# * sslkey - Key file location. The file must contain PEM encoded data.
# * sslrootcert - The location of the root certificate file. The file must contain PEM encoded data.
#
# Valid values for sslmode are:
#
# * disable - No SSL
# * require - Always SSL (skip verification)
# * verify-ca - Always SSL (verify that the certificate presented by the server was signed by a trusted CA)
# * verify-full - Always SSL (verify that the certification presented by the server was signed by a trusted CA and the server host name matches the one in the certificate)

# Automatically apply database migrations.
#
# It is possible to apply the database-migrations by hand
# (see https://github.com/brocaar/lora-app-server/tree/master/migrations)

## Securing the application-server internal API

In order to protect the application-server internal API (`[application_server.internal_api]`) against
unauthorized access and to encrypt all communication, it is advised to use TLS
certificates. Once the `ca_cert`, `tls_cert` and `tls_key` are set, the
API will enforce client certificate validation on all incoming connections.
This means that when configuring a network-server instance in LoRa App Server,
you must provide the CA and TLS client certificate in order to let the
network-server to connect to LoRa App Server. See also
[network-server management]({{< ref "use/network-servers.md" >}}).

See [https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver-certificates](https://github.com/brocaar/loraserver-certificates)
for a set of script to generate such certificates.

## Securing the join-server API

In order to protect the join-server API (`[join_server]`) against
unauthorized access and to encrypt all communication, it is advised to use TLS
certificates. Once the `ca_cert`, `tls_cert` and `tls_key` are
set, the API will enforce client certificate validation on all incoming connections.
When the `ca_cert` is left blank, TLS will still be configured, but the server
will not require and validate the client-certificate.

Please note that you also need to configure LoRa Server so that it uses a
client certificate for its join-server API client. See
[LoRa Server configuration](https://docs.loraserver.io/loraserver/install/config/).

## Securing the web-interface and public API

The web-interface and public api (`[application_server.public_api]`) can be
secured using a TLS certificate and key. Once the `tls_cert` and `tls_key`
are set (`[application_server.external_api]`), TLS will be activated.

### Self-signed certificate

A self-signed certificate can be generated with the following command:

{{<highlight bash>}}
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 90 -nodes
{{< /highlight >}}

### Let's Encrypt

For generating a certificate with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/),
first follow the [getting started](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/)
instructions. When the `letsencrypt` cli tool has been installed, execute:

{{<highlight bash>}}
letsencrypt certonly --standalone -d DOMAINNAME.HERE 
{{< /highlight >}}
