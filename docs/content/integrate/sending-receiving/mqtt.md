# MQTT integration

The MQTT integration publishes all the data it receices from the devices
as JSON over MQTT. To receive data from your device, you therefore 
need to subscribe to its MQTT topic. For debugging, you could use a 
(command-line) tool like `mosquitto_sub` which is part of the 
[Mosquitto](http://mosquitto.org/) MQTT broker.

Use `+` for a single-level wildcard, `#` for a multi-level wildcard.
Examples:

{{<highlight bash>}}
mosquitto_sub -t "application/123/#" -v          # display everything for the given application ID
mosquitto_sub -t "application/123/device/+/rx" -v  # display only the RX payloads for the given application ID

**Notes:**

* MQTT topics are case-sensitive
* The `ApplicationID` can be retrieved using the API or from the web-interface,
  this is not the `AppEUI`!

## Receiving

### application/[applicationID]/device/[devEUI]/rx

**Note:** for versions before v1.0.0 `.../device/..` was configured as
`.../node/...`. Please refer to the `application_server.integration.mqtt`
[configuration]({{<ref "install/config.md">}}) for the correct topic.

Topic for payloads received from your devices. Example payload:

{{<highlight json>}}
{
    "applicationID": "123",
    "applicationName": "temperature-sensor",
    "deviceName": "garden-sensor",
    "devEUI": "0202020202020202",
    "rxInfo": [
        {
            "gatewayID": "0303030303030303",          // ID of the receiving gateway
            "name": "rooftop-gateway",                 // name of the receiving gateway
            "time": "2016-11-25T16:24:37.295915988Z",  // time when the package was received (GPS time of gateway, only set when available)

            "loRaSNR": 10,                             // signal to noise ratio
            "location": {
                "latitude": 52.3740364,  // latitude of the receiving gateway

            }
        }
    ],
    "txInfo": {
        "frequency": 868100000,  // frequency used for transmission
        "dr": 5                  // data-rate used for transmission
    },
    "adr": false,                  // device ADR status
    "fCnt": 10,                    // frame-counter
    "fPort": 5,                    // FPort
    "data": "...",                 // base64 encoded payload (decrypted)
    "object": {                    // decoded object (when application coded has been configured)
        "temperatureSensor": {"1": 25},
        "humiditySensor": {"1": 32}
    }
}
{{< /highlight >}}

### application/[applicationID]/device/[devEUI]/status

Topic for battery and margin status received from devices. Example payload:

{{<highlight json>}}
{
    "applicationID": "123",
    "applicationName": "temperature-sensor",
    "deviceName": "garden-sensor",
    "devEUI": "0202020202020202",
    "battery": 200,
    "margin": 6
}
{{< /highlight >}}

When configured by the [service-profile]({{<ref "use/service-profiles.md">}})
and when published by the device, this payload contains the device status.

#### `battery`

* `0` - The end-device is connected to an external power source
* `1..254` - The battery level, 1 being at minimum and 254 being at maximum
* `255` - The end-device was not able to measure the battery level

#### `margin`

The demodulation signal-to-noise ratio in dB rounded
to the nearest integer valuefor the last successfully received device-status
request by the network-server.

### application/[applicationID]/device/[devEUI]/join

**Note:** for versions before v1.0.0 `.../device/..` was configured as

    "data": "...."                            // base64 encoded data (plaintext, will be encrypted by LoRa Server)
    "object": {                               // decoded object (when application coded has been configured)
        "temperatureSensor": {"1": 25},       // when providing the 'object', you can omit 'data'
