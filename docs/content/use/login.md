# Web-interface login

By default, the web-interface is accessible on port `8080` using https.
When running LoRa App Server locally, this means you should navigate to
[https://localhost:8080/](https://localhost:8080). Mind the http**s**!

After installing LoRa App Server, you can login with the default credentials
user: `admin`, password: `admin`. For security reasons, you should change
this password as soon as possible.
