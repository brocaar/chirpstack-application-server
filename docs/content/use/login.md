# Web-interface login

If a TLS certificate has been configured (optional), use http**s://**
else use the http:// option (default).

* **http://** [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
* **https://** [https://localhost:8080/](https://localhost:8080/)


When running ChirpStack Application Server locally, this means you should navigate to
[http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080) (in case of http://).

After installing ChirpStack Application Server, you can login with the default credentials
user: `admin`, password: `admin`. For security reasons, you should change
this password as soon as possible.
